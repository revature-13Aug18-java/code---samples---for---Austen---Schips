# Project 3: https://github.com/revaturelabs/rideshare-map-service

### Description:
Worked on the second sprint of Revature's RideForce application. This application was built using a Microservices architecture, and allows Revature associates to secure transportation to and from work. I worked as a member of the MapService team. I helped implement the favorite location user story, and ensured adequate code-coverage for our service using JUnit and ECLEmma.
