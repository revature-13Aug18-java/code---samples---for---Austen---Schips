# Project 0

Used the DAO design pattern to create a banking application wherein users can login and logout, view their balance, and deposit or withdraw money. Read user input using Java's scanner class, and used log4j to print to the console. Connected the middle-tier and back-end using Oracle's driver manager to establish a connection.
