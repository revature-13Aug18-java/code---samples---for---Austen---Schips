# Project 0

Used the DAO design pattern to create a banking application wherein users can login and logout, view their balance, and deposit or withdraw money. By using Java's scanner class, I allowed for user input, utilizing log4j to print to the console. I connected the middle-tier and back-end using Oracle's driver manager to establish a connection. 

User Stories:
	1) create a user account with a unique email and/or username
  2) secure my account using a password
	3) log in/log out
	4) create a bank account associated with each user
	5) deposit money
	6) withdraw money (no negative balances!)
	7) view account balance
