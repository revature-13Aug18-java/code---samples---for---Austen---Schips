# Austen's Code Samples

This repository contains the project-oriented code that I have worked on over the course of my employment at Revature. Projects 0 and 1 were solo projects that showcase my abilities at the start of this training program. For project 2, I worked in a team with two other associates. Last, in project 3, I worked on the map service as a member of the microservices team.

Project 0: Created a banking applicaition using a database-first approach and communicating with the database via JDBC.

Project 1: Constructed an expense reimbursement system to allow employees to submit reimbursements, and allow managers to approve them.

Project 2: Using a code-first approach, helped assemble a superhero team builder, wherein users can compare their team against another user's team.

Project 3: Worked on the second sprint of Revature's RideForce application asserting the behavior of our code via JUnit testing.
