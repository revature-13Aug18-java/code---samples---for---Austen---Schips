# Project 2 - Superhero Directory: https://github.com/MaxEffect13/project2

### Description:
The Superhero Directory is a team-built, full-stack web application that allows users to create a team of six superheroes and battle    against another user's team. Calls to an API allow for the display of heroes on the homepage. By clicking on a hero, a user can access the statistics and traits of each hero. Then, the user can decide whether to add that hero to a team, or continue the search for the perfect team candidate. I was responsible for creating and maintaining our relational database, as well as our application's services, repositories, and entities. Additionally, I handled the combat logic and implemented the corresponding combat controller.

Technology Stack:
Java , AWS RDS, CI/CD pipeline (EC2, Maven, Jenkins, GitHub, Slack), Hibernate, Spring MVC, Angular, Bootstrap.
Logging with Log4J, Sonarlint/Sonarcloud for code quality, and unit testing with JUnit
